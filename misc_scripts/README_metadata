Metadata files
--------------

From Release 17 of Ensembl Genomes, a selection of files are provided that contain metadata for the genomes provided through Ensembl Genomes.

The following formats are available:

.txt
Tab separated file with the following columns:
- name - full name of species/strain
- species - computationally safe version of species as used internally by Ensembl
- division - division of Ensembl Genomes (e.g. EnsemblFungi)
- taxonomy_id - NCBI taxonomy ID
- assembly - version of assembly
- genebuild - version of genebuild
- variation - Y/N indicating if variation data is available	
- pan_compara - Y/N indicating if the genome is included in the pan taxonomic compara
- genome_alignments - Y/N indicating if the genome is included in whole genome alignments
- other_alignments - Y/N indicating if the genome has been aligned against other sequences e.g. EST, short read data
- core_db	- name of MySQL core database
- species_id - ID of genome with MySQL core database

.json
JSON format file containing full details of the analyses available for each genome as an array named "genome". Each element of the array contains the following keys:
- name - full name of species/strain
- species - computationally safe version of species as used internally by Ensembl
- division - division of Ensembl Genomes (e.g. EnsemblFungi)
- taxonomy_id - NCBI taxonomy ID
- assembly_name - version of assembly
- genebuild_id - version of genebuild
- pan_species - 0/1 indicating if the genome is included in the pan taxonomic compara
- db_name - name of MySQL core database
- species_id - ID of genome with MySQL core database
- annotation - associated array containing the following keys:
-- nProteinCoding - number of protein-coding genes in this genome
-- nInterPro - number of InterPro entries annotated to protein-coding genes in this genome
-- nInterProDomains - number of InterPro domains annotated to protein-coding genes in this genome
-- nGO - number of GO terms annotated to protein-coding genes in this genome
-- nUniProtKBSwissProt - number of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries annotated to protein-coding genes in this genome
-- nUniProtKBTrEMBL - number of UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries annotated to protein-coding genes in this genome
-- nProteinCodingUniProtKB - number of protein-coding genes with UniProtKB cross-references
-- nProteinCodingUniProtKBSwissProt - number of protein-coding genes with UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot cross-references
-- nProteinCodingUniProtKBTrEMBL - number of protein-coding genes with UniProtKB/TrEMBL cross-references
-- nProteinCodingInterPro - number of protein-coding genes with InterPro domains
-- nProteinCodingGO - number of protein-coding genes with GO terms
- variation - associative array containing counts of variations keyed by source names
- compara - associative array where keys are names of comparative analyses that the genome is involved in, and values are lists of genomes included in those analyses
- features - associative array with the following keys
-- proteinAlignFeatures - associative array of analysis names and counts of protein-genome alignments
-- dnaAlignFeatures - associative array of analysis names and counts of DNA-genome alignments
-- repeateFeatures - associative array of analysis names and counts of repetitive sequence features
-- simpleFeatures - associative array of analysis names and counts of other genomic features
- bam - associative array where keys are names of BAM file types (dna, rnaseq etc.), and values are arrays of associative arrays, one per BAM file with the following keys:
-- source_name - descriptive name of BAM file
-- source_url - URL where BAM file can be found
-- id - unique identifier of BAM file
-- description - longer description of the BAM file

.xml
An XML version of the JSON format described above

Files are available for Ensembl Genomes as a whole:
species.txt
species_metadata.xml
species_metadata.json

and per division e.g.
fungi/species_EnsemblFungi.txt
fungi/species_metadata_EnsemblFungi.xml
fungi/species_metadata_EnsemblFungi.json
